# Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

### MVP:

- A list of all their animals and their admission date
- Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
- Assign an animal to a new owner
- List all the owners and their adopted animals

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for animals/owners
- Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
- Search for animals by breed/type
- Any other ideas you might come up with


### Built with:
